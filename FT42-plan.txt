﻿I did
* What Encryption Standards are Used in Industry? Why?
* Read about c++ libraries.
* Understand AES(Advanced Encryption Technique) 
* Search which libraries support AES.
   * Crypto++,botan etc.
* Use Crypto++ library for AES.
* Read about Key Exchange algorithms.
   * RSA(3072 bits)
   * Diffi-Helman(3072 bits0
   * Curve 25519 (256 bit)        |Fix length algorithm
   * Four(255 bit)                |Fix length algorithm
* Understand the Diffie-Hellman Algorithm.
* Implement in a single file.(calculations in a single program).
* Read and Prepare presentation for SSL protocols, Diffie-Hemana and RSA.
* Understand Socket programming 


Next plan
* Read on socket programming and learn to use existing libraries of socket programming.
* Implement diffie-hellman using socket programming with libraries and without libraries.
* Read A Method for Obtaining Digital Signatures and Public-Key Cryptosystems by Rivest–Shamir–Adleman for more details.
* Read Network based Security model using Symmetric Key Cryptography (AES 256– Rijndael Algorithm) with Public Key Exchange Protocol (Diffie-Hellman Key ExchangeProtocol) paper on how Secure channel works.
